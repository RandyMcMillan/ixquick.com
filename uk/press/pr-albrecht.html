<p>
The world's most privacy-friendly search engine, Ixquick.com, announced today that Dr. Katherine Albrecht will head up the company's US media relations and marketing outreach efforts.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Albrecht is a respected expert in the privacy arena, with a decade of experience as a privacy researcher, activist, and frequent media commentator. She is a perhaps best known for her work on privacy issues associated with RFID (radio frequency identification) and retail data collection. Albrecht co-authored the best-selling book "Spychips," and hosts a daily, syndicated radio talk show. Her writings on privacy have appeared in several notable publications, including Scientific American and the Denver University Law Review.
</p>

<p>
"I'm excited to be working with Ixquick because I'm a huge fan of their product," said Albrecht. "Ixquick.com guarantees to delete all search data so it can't be abused by Big Brother bureaucrats and snoopy marketers. I've been using Ixquick as my own search engine for months, and I can't wait to tell others who care about privacy as much as I do."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht is in a good position to spread the word, having granted literally thousands of interviews to radio, print, and television journalists worldwide. Executive Technology Magazine calls her "possibly the country's single most vocal privacy advocate and staunchest opponent of technologies that track consumers," and Wired.com calls her a "PR genius." 
</p>

<p>
Albrecht will work from New Hampshire and report to Ixquick CEO Robert Beens at the company's headquarters in the Netherlands. She will be responsible for strategy, execution, and management of all media communications and marketing initiatives in the US.
</p>

<p>
"We are thrilled to have Katherine on board," said Ixquick CEO Robert Beens. "Her knowledge of privacy and her media experience will be a tremendous asset to Ixquick. We are confident that she will do a great job of educating the American public about search engine privacy and how Ixquick.com can help."
</p>

<p>
Albrecht holds a Doctorate in Consumer Education and a Masters in Instructional Technology from Harvard University. She received an undergraduate degree in International Marketing from the University of Southern California, graduating with magna cum laude honors.
