<h1 style="margin-top:6px;">Ixquick.com eliminates 'Big Brother'</h1><p>
<font style="font-size:16px; text-align:justify; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify">
HAARLEM, The Netherlands, June 27, 2006<p>As personal privacy concerns create growing alarm about the freedom of the Internet, the
Ixquick metasearch engine (www.ixquick.com) has taken a pioneering step: starting today,
Ixquick will permanently delete all personal search details gleaned from its users from the log
files.<p>&quot;This new feature of our search engine ensures both optimal privacy protection and maximum
search performance for our customers, since they will be able to search using the 11 best
search engines without their personal data being recorded,&quot; says Ixquick spokesman Alex van
Eesteren.<p>As digital technology increasingly pervades our world, more and more personal details are
being stored electronically, many of them by search engines. While you are searching the
internet, these engines register the time of your searches, the terms you used, the sites you
visited and your IP address. In many cases this IP address makes it possible to trace the
computer, and in turn the household, that carried out the search.<p>These personal details are often retained for long periods by search engines and are of interest to commercial parties, governments and even criminals.<br>
&quot;Many search engines openly use this data for commercial purposes. It seems only to be a
question of time before the data gets misused,&quot; alleges Van Eesteren. &quot;Therefore we have
decided to permanently delete all personal search records. If the data is not stored, users
privacy can't be breached&quot;. <p>Ixquick's Meta Search feature enables the user to simultaneously search 11 of the best search
engines. However, Ixquick does not share the user's personal data with these individual search
engines in any circumstances. In addition, as of this week, Ixquick will delete the users' IP
addresses and 'unique user IDs' from its own 'Log Files'.<p>&quot;Therefore, any user can use Ixquick.com to search in a combination of the best search
engines secure in the knowledge that they can enjoy complete protection of their privacy,&quot;
