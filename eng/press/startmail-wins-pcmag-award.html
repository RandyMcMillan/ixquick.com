        <p align="justify">Zeist, Netherlands (PRWEB) &#150; StartMail.com has earned PCMag's coveted Editors' Choice Award, its highest rating. Lead Security Analyst Neil Rubenking praised the new private email service, saying, &#147;StartMail may be the easiest way ever to protect your email conversations using industry-standard encryption.&#148;*</p>

        <p align="justify">&#147;We're excited to win this prestigious honor from PC Magazine,&#148; said StartMail CEO Robert Beens. &#147;We've worked hard make secure email available to everyone -- not just experts, and we're glad our hard work has been recognized.&#148;</p>

        <p align="justify">StartMail combines powerful, state-of-the-art privacy with ease of use. It is web-based, supports IMAP, and offers tools like disposable email addresses, Q & A encryption for when friends don't have encryption set up, and multiple layers of security to prevent messages from being read by third parties. StartMail's one-click PGP encryption lets regular users take advantage of this powerful privacy tool that used to be a challenge for even sophisticated users.</p>

        <p align="justify">PC Magazine concurs. &#147;The nice thing is, you don't have to dive headlong into understanding public/private key encryption,&#148; Rubenking noted. &#147;You can just start using it with StartMail.&#148;*</p>

        <p align="justify">Ed Snowden has recommended PGP encryption to protect against government bulk data collection programs, saying, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/17/encrypting-your-email-works-says-nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden/" target="_blank">&#147;Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on.&#148;</a></p>

        <p align="justify">StartMail's easy-to-use service has attracted a passionate community of subscribers seeking an alternative to so-called free email services like Yahoo and Gmail <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/2/4388680/yahoo-mail-classic-shutdown-all-user-email-scanned-for-targeted-ads" target="_blank">that scan and store every email that passes through their servers.</a></p>

        <p align="justify">As Rubenking points out, those email services come at a high cost to your privacy. &#147;You can pay dollars up front, or you can pay by letting Internet giants filter your email for keywords that they then use in targeting ads. How you pay is your choice.&#148;*</p>

        <p align="justify">StartMail never scans customer emails for marketing purposes. What's more, StartMail charges a fair market price so it is not obligated to marketers, government agencies, or corporate donors. One-year StartMail subscriptions are $59.95 (&#8364;49,95), or about $5 per month, and can be purchased online at <a href="https://www.startmail.com/" target="_blank">https://www.startmail.com</a>.</p>

        <p align="justify">StartMail is based in the Netherlands, outside of U.S. jurisdiction, where it is not directly subject to U.S. mass surveillance mandates. The company has vowed never to cooperate with programs like PRISM, and its founders have a proven track record of protecting user privacy. StartMail was built by the team behind StartPage.com and Ixquick.com, the world's most private search engines, which launched the private search revolution over 10 years ago. StartPage gives users anonymous access to Google results, while Ixquick lets them privately search other leading search engines.</p>
