   <p align="justify">Zeist, The Netherlands (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a target="_blank" href="http://startpage.com">StartPage.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../../index.html">Ixquick.com</a>, the world's most private search engines, don't just have a brand new look. They now sport privacy-friendly Google map snapshots, enhanced video search, and upgraded image search results that are automatically proxied for 100% anonymity.</p>

        <p align="justify">Fans are impressed, calling the new design "cool," "modern," and "sleek."</p>

        <p align="justify">"It's great to be launching a new logo, and we're excited about our redesigned features," said CEO Robert Beens. "Of course, our users can still confidently rely on the things we're not changing -- great security and state-of-the-art privacy protection."</p>

        <p align="justify">The company's private search and proxy will continue to be free, and the "classic" design and themes are still available as options. What's more, the company won't be changing one of its most popular features: its location in the Netherlands.</p>

        <p align="justify">"Ed Snowden showed how the U.S. government can coerce American companies into handing over people's data," he said. "Because our company is based outside US jurisdiction, we are not subject to the Patriot Act or other data collection programs like PRISM. We never collect data on our users and we will never cooperate with bulk spying programs."</p>

        <p align="justify">Beens promised that StartPage will continue to serve anonymized Google search results, and Ixquick will continue to provide equally private metasearch results from top search engines.</p>

        <p align="justify">"We will keep to our roots while advancing the work we pioneered when we launched the private search revolution over 10 years ago," Beens added. "We do private search better than anyone, and we never collect or store any personal information about our users. Nada. Zilch. Zero."</p>

        <p align="justify">In fact, StartPage and Ixquick are the only search engines to have earned Europrise third-party certification of their ground-breaking privacy promises:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>No IP addresses recorded</li>
			<li>No tracking cookies used</li>
			<li>No record made of users' searches</li>
		</ul>
        <p align="justify">"We are proud of our innovations in private search, and we continue to develop new ways to protect privacy, like our recently launched private email service, StartMail.com," Beens noted.</p>

        <p align="justify">StartMail, developed by the team behind StartPage and Ixquick, offers paid private email. Its revolutionary one-click encryption option protects email messages so only the intended recipients can read them.</p>    
	
		<p>"Privacy is a fundamental human right," said Beens. "Our mission is to provide easy-to-use solutions that protect people from blanket surveillance and help them embrace their right to privacy."</p>
