<h2><i>The World's Most Private Search Engine now makes SSL encryption the default</i></h2></p>

<font style="font-size:16px; text-align:justify; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify">

 October 24, 2011
<p align='justify'>As of today, Ixquick, the "world's most private search engine", automatically encrypts ALL searches. Ixquick was the first search engine to offer SSL encryption in 2009, and today it again breaks new ground by making SSL encryption the default.</p>
<p align='justify'>SSL encryption, also known as secure socket layer encryption, is widely praised by security experts as the most secure way to surf the web. Ixquick's encryption prevents eavesdropping by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who may become legally required to store massive amounts of personal information on you.</p>
<p align='justify'>"Snooping ISP's or hackers could become an enormous, Orwellian privacy threat," says Robert E.G. Beens, CEO of Ixquick. "That's why we've decided to change our websites’ default to 100% SSL encryption, to further protect the privacy of our users' Internet searches."</p>
<p align='justify'>All visitors to Ixquick.com and its sister search engine Startpage.com will benefit from the new encryption service, which will automatically redirect them to the secure website. Users will see the letters "HTTPS" in the URL bar, indicating that all data will be transmitted in encrypted form. Any hacker or eavesdropper who accesses the connection will simply see gobbledygook.</p>
<p align='justify'>Other search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing have begun to follow Ixquick’s lead by offering SSL encryption. However, the privacy benefits of using SSL with other major search engines may be misleading, since those search engines themselves record users' IP address and store extensive records of their searches.</p>

<p align='justify'>"When you use Ixquick.com or Startpage.com, your IP address is not recorded, your visit is not logged, and no tracking cookies are placed on your browser," explains Beens. "In fact, we do not record any information about our users. Nothing. Nada. Zilch".</p>
<p align='justify'>Automatic SSL encryption is just the latest addition to the growing family of privacy features which combine to make Ixquick the world's most private search engine.</p>
