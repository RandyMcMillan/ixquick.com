<h1 style="margin-top:6px;">STARTPAGE, WORLD'S #1 PRIVACY SEARCH ENGINE, TO LAUNCH IN AUSTRALIA</h1>
<h2><i>Privacy powerhouse goes "down under" to offer private, anonymous search geared to local interests</i></h2></p>

<font style="font-size:16px; text-align:justify; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify">

<p align='justify'>Zeist, The Netherlands, June 1, 2010 - Startpage by Ixquick, the global leader in private Internet search for over a decade, is excited to announce the launch of "Startpage Australia," a region-specific version of the popular Startpage.com search engine. The website, set to debut in June, is online at <a href="https://www.startpage.com/au/">www.Startpage.com/au</a>.</p>
<p align='justify'>Startpage VP of Marketing and Media Relations, privacy expert Dr. Katherine Albrecht, will visit Australia from June 1-9 to meet with Australian privacy advocates and speak with government officials.
Startpage will hold a press conference in Sydney on June 3 to launch the service.</p>

<p align='justify'>Designed to address the privacy needs of Australia's 20 million people, Startpage Australia will supplement Startpage's existing search results with data from local, Australia-specific websites and portals. The search results will be more geared to local tastes and preferences, making Startpage the ideal search engine for privacy-conscious Australians.</p>

<p align='justify'>The move comes as Australians have grown alarmed at government controls and incursions into their use of the Internet. A leaked blacklist of government censored websites last year caused a firestorm of controversy, and last month Google released figures showing that the Australian government
submitted more than 150 requests for user data to Google in a recent six-month period.</p>
<p align='justify'>"The serious problems of Internet censorship and personal data collection in Australia are issues of worldwide concern. We are reaching out to help with the launch of Startpage AU," said Ixquick CEO
Robert Beens. "We want to extend a warm welcome to the people of Australia, and invite them to use
the Startpage search engine as a tool to protect their privacy and anonymity."</p>
<p align='justify'>As a "meta-search engine," Startpage allows users to anonymously search nine other search engines at once and receive the best results privately. Startpage does not record user IP addresses or use tracking cookies. In contrast, other major search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, and Google record every search query made through their websites and link them to the user's IP address.</p>

<p align='justify'>Startpage provides secure SSL encryption and offers a proxy service that allows users to anonymously visit the sites they find through the Startpage search engine. Startpage has been widely praised by the privacy community, receiving kudos from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, privacy regulators in
Europe, and Internet users worldwide.</p>
