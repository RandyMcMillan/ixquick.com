<h2><i>Free, innovative proxy service offers complete online privacy</i></h2></p>

<font style="font-size:16px; text-align:justify; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify">

 January 28, International Data Privacy Day 2010
<p align='justify'>Ixquick, the world's most private search engine, and its U.S. brand, Startpage.com, today announced the release of a new proxy service that allows users to surf the web with complete privacy. The proxy lets users browse websites safely and anonymously, without passing on any private, personally identifiable information to the websites they view.</p>
<p align='justify'>The Ixquick proxy is a free service that works in conjunction with the Ixquick search engine, available at <a href="../../index.html">www.ixquick.com</a>. When users perform a search, they will find a clickable "proxy" option below each search result. When this option is selected,  Ixquick acts as an intermediary to retrieve the page and display it in a privacy-protected Ixquick window.</p>
<p align='justify'>The proxy offers complete anonymity, since the user never makes direct contact with the third-party website. The user's IP address is invisible to the viewed website. In addition, the website cannot see or place cookies on the user's browser.</p>
<p align='justify'>The proxy service is covered by the same privacy policy that has made Ixquick the industry leader when it comes to search engine privacy. Ixquick does not record IP addresses, make a record of users' searches, or record details about proxy usage. The company's data collection practices are third-party certified with the "European Privacy seal" and widely considered the best in the industry.</p>
<p align='justify'>The proxy service is being launched today, January 28th, to celebrate international Data Privacy Day.</p>
<p align='justify'>"People are more concerned about online data retention policies than ever before," said CEO Robert Beens. "We wanted to offer them a useful tool and this proxy is a logical extension of our services, A search engine is a starting point for people to visit other pages. Now our users can take the privacy they get with Ixquick to the next step, and go privately to the sites they have found as well. 
This proxy completes the total search privacy picture."</p>
<p align='justify'>Details on the new Ixquick Proxy service, along with a video explaining the service by Ixquick's US spokeswoman, privacy expert Dr. Katherine Albrecht, can be found on the "Ixquick Proxy Explained" page: <a href="../../proxy/eng/help.html">https://ixquick.com/proxy/eng/help.html</a> </p>
    <p align='justify'>The video can also be viewed directly at: <a id='watchTheVideo' class='topopup' href="../../vd/ixquick-proxy-service-Luovo73Bjqc.mp4" onclick="addVideo(event, 'https://ixquick.com/vd/ixquick-proxy-service-Luovo73Bjqc.mp4', 'Video or Audio couldn\'t be played as JwPlayer require flash player 10 or above');"  style="display:inline"><strong>Watch the Proxy video</strong></a></p>
<p align='justify'>People wishing to experience the Ixquick proxy can perform a search at: <br><a href="../../index.html">https://www.ixquick.com</a>, then click the "proxy" option below the search result.</p>
