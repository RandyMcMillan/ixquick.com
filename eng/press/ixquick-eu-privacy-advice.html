    <h2 style="margin-top:6px;">WHEN EUROPE NEEDS PRIVACY ADVICE, IT TURNS TO IXQUICK, "THE WORLD'S MOST PRIVATE SEARCH ENGINE" </h2> 
    <h3><i>Over the next few weeks, the politicians deciding Europe’s technological future will meet with Goliath, Goliath, Goliath... and David.</i></h3></p>
    
<font style="font-size:16px; text-align:justify; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify">

   <p align='justify'>Europe is drafting new Data Protection regulations, with a vote scheduled for May 29th. When members of the EU Parliament meet to discuss how much access to grant big business to people's personal, online information, who sits at the table?</p>

<p align='justify'>The Goliaths are the usual players, familiar names like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo. And the David?</p>

<p align='justify'><a href = "../../index.html" target = "_blank">Ixquick.com</a>.</p>

<p align='justify'><a href = "../../index.html" target = "_blank">Ixquick.com</a> is the anonymous search engine based in the Netherlands. The company is routinely consulted behind closed doors because it understands both the intricacies of search technology and the downsides of collecting personal data through those searches.</p>

<p align='justify'>More importantly, Ixquick and its sister search engine, StartPage, are unique -- they do not collect any information on their users. This approach earned Ixquick the first-ever EuroPriSe Privacy Seal, the coveted industry award lauding the company's commitment to user privacy, an award it has received consistently every year since 2008.
<br>
"The big players use their search engines to capture people's personal details so they can exploit them for commercial purposes. We never want to see that data abused, so we've broken new ground by promising never to collect it in the first place," said Ixquick CEO Robert Beens.</p>

<p align='justify'>Policy makers appreciate the fact that not only does Ixquick understand how online threats to privacy occur, but it offers concrete, practical solutions to stop them.
<br>
This unique position is increasingly popular with consumers worldwide. Along with its American counterpart, StartPage, Ixquick's searches have doubled over the past year to nearly 3 million searches a day -- all of them completely anonymous -- proving it's possible to build a profitable business by embracing privacy and building trust with consumers.</p>

<p align='justify'>To find out more about online Privacy, why it matters and where it’s headed, do as the EU Parliament has done and contact Ixquick to learn more.</p>
