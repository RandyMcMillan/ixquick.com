   December 11, 2013

   <p align='justify'>Well-known privacy and security expert Dr. Katherine Albrecht has been selected as Associate Editor of the prestigious Technology and Society Magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE).</p>

<p align='justify'>"I am delighted that Dr. Albrecht has accepted my invitation to join the Magazine," said Associate Professor Katina Michael of the University of Wollongong, Australia, the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Technology and Society Magazine. "She brings to the Magazine a front line understanding of how technology impacts society. She has faced the hard questions head-on and got organizations thinking about their policies and practices."</p>

<p align='justify'>Albrecht received her Ed.D. from Harvard and has cross-disciplinary qualifications in business administration, instructional technology, and human development and psychology. She also completed graduate-level coursework at the MIT Media Lab, and in MIT's Science, Technology, and Society program.</p>

<p align='justify'>She is best known for educating the public about the privacy downsides of cloud-based Internet services, consumer loyalty shopper cards, and radio frequency identification (RFID). Her activism against the RFID industry led to the best-selling book "Spychips," which exposed how governments and global corporations planned to track the whereabouts and habits of everyday consumers using RFID microchipped products.</p>

<p align='justify'>In addition to academic expertise in privacy and security, Albrecht has hands-on experience dealing with technology as a Vice President and spokesperson for <a href='https://www.startpage.com/' target='_blank' >StartPage.com</a>, a private search engine company. She is also working on the rollout of <a href='https://www.startmail.com/' target='_blank' >StartMail.com</a>, a soon-to-be-launched privacy-friendly, paid email service.</p>


<p align='justify'>"Our Magazine is well known for publishing controversial pieces on the negative and positive consequences of technologies," said Michael. "Albrecht&#146;s contributions and integrity will continue to encourage this balance and promote the continued credibility of this pacesetting Magazine."</p>
