   <p align='justify'>Zeist, Netherlands: Former President Jimmy Carter can now send email in total privacy with a StartMail account.</p>

<p align='justify'>StartMail, the new private email service, offered the former U.S. President and his family lifetime accounts after he recently admitted to using "snail mail" due to surveillance concerns. In an interview with Meet the Press on Sunday, Carter said, "I have felt that my own communications are probably monitored. And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write the letter myself, put it in the post office, and mail it."</p>

<p align='justify'>"It's sad that the former leader of the free world avoids emailing because his privacy may be compromised by his own government," said consumer privacy expert Dr. Katherine Albrecht, who is helping to launch StartMail.</p>

<p align='justify'>"Law-abiding citizens have a right to privacy and should be able to keep their email safe from hackers, snoops, and government agents," she added. "That's why we created StartMail with privacy in mind."</p>

<p align='justify'>Messages sent through StartMail are protected against surveillance by powerful PGP encryption, considered the gold standard when it comes to protecting digital communications.</p>

<p align='justify'>Until now, PGP encryption has been hard to use, so only people with technical skills could employ its protections. Now StartMail puts this powerful privacy tool into everyone's hands -- even beginners -- offering easy-to-use, foolproof PGP encryption with just one click.</p>

<p align='justify'>StartMail was created by the same people who developed private search engines StartPage.com and Ixquick.com.</p>

<p align='justify'>StartMail has experienced a huge demand for the service, which Albrecht attributes in part to Edward Snowden's revelations about government spying programs, and his confirmation that PGP encryption is indeed effective against NSA snooping.</p>

<p align='justify'>StartMail is currently in beta testing, and formal paid accounts are slated to roll out later this year by invitation only. Interested parties can sign up to receive an invitation at <a href='https://www.startmail.com/' target='_blank'>https://www.StartMail.com</a>. Journalists who would like a tour of StartMail in advance of release may contact the company.</p>
