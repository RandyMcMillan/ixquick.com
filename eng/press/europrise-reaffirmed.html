</p>
<h4 style=" font-size:18px; font-weight: normal;"><em>Netherlands based Surfboard Holding B.V. proved that their meta search engines Ixquick and Startpage still meet all relevant requirements of EU data protection law.</em></h4>

<p>Bonn, July 20, 2015</p>

<font style="font-size:16px; text-align:justify; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" align="justify">
<p>
    Surfboard Holding B.V. runs a meta search engine which is provided under two different names: Ixquick and Startpage. Both versions of the service use the same IT-systems, but a different look and feel. Users can search the Internet for web pages, images and videos, therefore making use of multiple third party search engines.
</p>

<p>
    Ixquick and Startpage especially focus on protecting the privacy of their users: Notably, they do not store users&#146; search terms, IP addresses and user agent information and offer a proxy to view search results anonymously. In 2008, the very first European Privacy Seal was awarded to Surboard Holding for an earlier version of Ixquick. Since then, the service has been continuously improved in terms of privacy and the seal has been renewed on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
   &#148;Surfboard goes to great lengths to preserve the privacy of Ixquick&#146;s and Startpage&#146;s users.&#148; says Sebastian Meissner, Head of the EuroPriSe Certification Authority. &#147;They implemented a terrific bundle of privacy-friendly functionalities which absolutely deserve to be labelled as privacy-enhancing technologies.&#148;
</p>

<p>
&#147;Trust is a key element of our privacy-friendly products, but trust needs to be verified.&#148; says Robert Beens, CEO of Surfboard Holding. &#147;The high-quality certification standards of the EuroPriSe Privacy Seal guarantee our users that they can trust us with their privacy.&#148;
