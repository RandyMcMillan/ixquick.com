<h2 style="margin-top:1px; margin-bottom:30px;text-align:center;">Giant US government Internet spying scandal revealed</h2> 
</p>

<p align='justify'>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> and The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data" target="_blank">Guardian</a> have revealed a US government mass Internet surveillance program code-named "PRISM". They report that the NSA and the FBI have been tapping directly into the servers of nine US service providers, including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Yahoo, YouTube, AOL and Skype, and began this surveillance program at least seven years ago. (<a href="prism-slides.html" onclick="return open_pop(this.href);">clarifying slides</a>)</p>

<p align='justify'>These revelations are shaking up an international debate.</p>
<p align='justify'><b>Ixquick</b> has always been very outspoken when it comes to protecting people's Privacy and civil liberties. So it won't surprise you that we are a strong opponent of overreaching, unaccountable spy programs like PRISM. In the past, even government surveillance programs that were begun with good intentions have become tools for abuse, for example tracking civil rights and anti-war protesters.</p>
<p align='justify'>Programs like PRISM undermine our Privacy, disrupt faith in governments, and are a danger to the free Internet.</p>
<p align='justify'><b>Ixquick</b> and its sister search engine <b>StartPage</b> have in their 14-year history never provided a single byte of user data to the US government, or any other government or agency. Not under PRISM, nor under any other program in the US, nor under any program anywhere in the world.</p>

<p><b>Here's how we are different:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ixquick does not store any user data.</b> We make this perfectly clear to everyone, including any governmental agencies. We do not record the IP addresses of our users and we don't use tracking cookies, so there is literally no data about you on our servers to access. Since we don't even know who our customers are, we can't share anything with Big Brother. In fact, we've never gotten even a single request from a governmental authority to supply user data in the fourteen years we've been in business.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Ixquick uses encryption (HTTPS) by default</b>. Encryption prevents snooping. Your searches are encrypted, so others can't "tap" the Internet connection to snoop what you're searching for. This combination of not storing data together with using strong encryption for the connections is key in protecting your Privacy.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Our company is based in The Netherlands, Europe</b>. US jurisdiction does not apply to us, at least not directly. Any request or demand from ANY government (including the US) to deliver user data, will be thoroughly checked by our lawyers, and we will not comply unless the law which actually applies to us would undeniably require it from us. And even in that hypothetical situation, we refer to our first point; we don't even have any user data to give. We will never cooperate with voluntary spying programs like PRISM.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Ixquick cannot be forced to start spying</b>. Given the strong protection of the Right to Privacy in Europe, European governments cannot just start forcing service providers like us to implement a blanket spying program on their users. And if that ever changed, we would fight this to the end.</li>

</ul>
<h2 style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:20px;text-align:center;">Privacy. It's not just our policy, it's our mission.</h2>
<p>Sincerely,<br><br>Robert E.G. Beens<br>CEO Ixquick.com and StartPage.com</p>
